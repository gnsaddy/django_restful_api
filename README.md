## API : Application Programming Interface
```API
An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.
An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface to a software component or a system, that defines how other components or systems 
can use it. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, 
how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can 
extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.
An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be 
designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability.
